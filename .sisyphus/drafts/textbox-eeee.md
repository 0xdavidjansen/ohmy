# Draft: Textbox showing ":eeee/eeee/eeee"

## Requirements (confirmed)
- User reports that the string `:eeee/eeee/eeee` appears in a textbox.
- User replied "clear" (interpretation unclear: could mean 'please clear it' or 'understood').

## Technical Decisions
- (pending)

## Research Findings
- (pending)

## Open Questions
- What did the user mean by "clear"?
- Which application/site and which textbox?
- What exact keystrokes trigger it (holding `e`, pressing `/`, etc.)?
- Is an IME/input method/editor, browser extension, or editor plugin involved?
- Does it happen on other machines/browsers?

## Scope Boundaries
- INCLUDE: Identify likely causes (keyboard repeat, IME compose, snippet/emoji shortcodes, extension, accessibility/automation tools).
- EXCLUDE: Making code changes until we know the app/codebase involved.
